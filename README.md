# Exemplar-Based Face Parsing

This work has been published in CVPR 2013: [`Exemplar-Based Face Parsing`](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~lizhang/projects/face-parsing/).

## Packages:

* [train](train) contains tools for training network using various architectures. It can be further used for visulaization of network's performance. This section is mainly for pixelwise segmentation and scene-parsing.
* [visualize](visualize) can be used to view the performance of trained network on any video/image as an overlay. (Will be added soon)
